    <h2 class="modal-title">How Linear Regression Works</h2>
    <p>Click on the graph to add points to it. The goal is to draw a line that best fits the given data, whether is
        linear or quadratic. Then, run the Gradient Descent algorithm to watch how the computer “learns” the line of
        best fit. A larger number of iterations means the line will make a larger jump towards converging. </p>
    <br/>
    <p>The way this works is for each iteration, the “error” of the line (which is the squared sum of the distance
        between each point and its predicted value indicated by the line) is reduced by a little bit. Eventually, the
        algorithm will converge when the error is as small as it can be.</p>
